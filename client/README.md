# To Do

## Order History Page Changes

- If multiple products are ordered, consider a better way to display that on the order history list. As is, only the first product in the cart's photo and title is displayed. Maybe don't display an image or a product title at all, just an order number and total? 

- Maybe take inspiration from amazon here. Each order gets a box, each item gets a small section of the order box. This is the one.
